# Documentation Update Log

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Branch:** docs  
**Purpose:** Update documentation to reflect current project structure

## Summary

Updated all .md files to reflect the new organized `src/` folder structure. The old flat file structure (with files like `config.py`, `fruit_ninja_game.py` at the root) has been migrated to a proper package structure under `src/`, but documentation was still referencing the old paths.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. README.md (Main Project README)

**Issues:**

- Project structure showed old flat structure
- Troubleshooting sections referenced old file paths

**Changes:**

- ✅ Updated project structure diagram to show new `src/` organization
- ✅ Updated camera troubleshooting to reference `src/core/game.py` instead of `fruit_ninja_game.py`
- ✅ Updated hand detection references to `src/core/config.py` instead of `config.py`
- ✅ Updated gesture troubleshooting to use correct paths

### 2. SETUP.md

**Issues:**

- Project structure section showed old flat structure
- Migration notes suggested manual cleanup of files already moved

**Changes:**

- ✅ Updated project structure to show current organized layout
- ✅ Updated migration notes to indicate migration is complete
- ✅ Added clear mapping of old files to new locations in `old_files_backup/`

### 3. docs/QUICK_START.md

**Issues:**

- File guide table referenced old flat file structure
- Configuration examples used old paths
- Customization examples referenced old files
- Troubleshooting commands referenced old paths
- Flow diagram showed old structure
- Suggested running non-existent `fruit_ninja_game.py` directly

**Changes:**

- ✅ Updated file guide table to show new paths (e.g., `src/core/config.py`)
- ✅ Fixed all configuration edit examples to use `src/core/config.py`
- ✅ Updated entity addition examples to use `src/core/entities.py`
- ✅ Fixed game logic references to use `src/core/game.py`
- ✅ Updated gesture detector references to `src/cv/gesture_detector.py`
- ✅ Fixed flow diagram to show new structure
- ✅ Updated all troubleshooting examples to use correct paths
- ✅ Fixed customization examples to reference `src/core/` files
- ✅ Removed reference to running `fruit_ninja_game.py` directly

### 4. docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md

**Issues:**

- Referenced `setup_supabase.py` without `scripts/` prefix

**Changes:**

- ✅ Updated to `python scripts/setup_database.py` for consistency

## Files Verified as Correct

The following files were checked and found to be already up-to-date:

- ✅ `QUICK_FIX.md` - No outdated references
- ✅ `scripts/README.md` - Correctly references all scripts
- ✅ `tests/README.md` - Correctly references test files
- ✅ `docs/README.md` - Documentation index is accurate
- ✅ `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Already shows correct structure

## Current Project Structure

For reference, the correct current structure is:

```

```

## Migration Status

✅ **Complete** - All code has been migrated to new structure  
✅ **Complete** - All documentation now reflects new structure  
✅ **Complete** - Old files backed up in `old_files_backup/`  
✅ **Complete** - All imports use new paths

## Testing Recommendations

To verify all changes are working:

```bash
# 1. Validate structure
python tests/test_structure.py

# 2. Test game runs
python main.py --difficulty easy

# 3. Verify help text is correct
python main.py --help

# 4. Check leaderboard setup (if configured)
python scripts/setup_database.py
```

## Notes for Future Updates

When updating documentation, ensure:

1. All file paths use the `src/` structure
2. References to `config.py` should be `src/core/config.py`
3. References to `game.py` or `fruit_ninja_game.py` should be `src/core/game.py`
4. Script references should include `scripts/` prefix
5. Test references should include `tests/` prefix

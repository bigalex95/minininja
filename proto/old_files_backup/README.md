# Cleanup Notes

This directory contains backup files from the old flat structure.

## Contents

These are the original files before reorganization:

- `config.py` → now in `src/core/config.py`
- `entities.py` → now in `src/core/entities.py`
- `fruit_ninja_game.py` → now in `src/core/game.py`
- `gesture_detector.py` → now in `src/cv/gesture_detector.py`
- `hand_tracker.py` → now in `src/cv/hand_tracker.py`

## Can I Delete This?

Yes, once you've verified the new structure works:

1. Run tests: `python tests/test_structure.py`
2. Test the game: `python main.py`
3. If everything works, delete this folder: `rm -rf old_files_backup/`

## Why Keep It?

- Safety: Backup in case of issues
- Reference: Compare old vs new code
- Rollback: Easy to restore if needed

## When to Delete

Delete after:

- ✅ Tests pass
- ✅ Game runs successfully
- ✅ Leaderboard works
- ✅ No import errors
- ✅ You're confident with the new structure

Recommended: Keep for 1-2 weeks, then delete.
